# ERC721A NFT Smart Contract with Batch Minting and Whitelist Mint

This GitHub repository contains a smart contract written in Solidity that implements the ERC721A standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The contract incorporates features such as batch minting for cheaper gas fees and a whitelist minting function using a Merkle tree.

Features:
- Implements the ERC721A standard for NFTs, providing the basic functionality of token creation, ownership transfer, and token metadata.
- Supports batch minting, allowing multiple tokens to be minted in a single transaction, significantly reducing gas fees.
- Implements a whitelist minting function that utilizes a Merkle tree to efficiently verify the eligibility of multiple addresses for minting.
- Provides a flexible and extensible foundation for building NFT-based applications and platforms.
